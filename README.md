# cucumber-seleniumgrid-skeleton
This repository contains skeleton for a working cucumber - selenium grid app

## How to use
Clone this repo and adapt as you see fit...there are few pre-requisited you need to have before running:
* selenium grid downloaded and running on your machine
* if your selenium grid uses different browser than Chrome, adjust the WebDriverInit class (this was supposed to be quick & dirty, better implementation made this configurable in pom.xml perhaps)
* you need to have your selenium grid url (skeleton assumes it's http://172.17.0.1:4444)
